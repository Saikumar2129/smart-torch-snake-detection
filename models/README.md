# Models Directory

This directory contains trained machine learning models and model checkpoints.

## Structure
- `checkpoints/`: Model checkpoints during training
- `final/`: Final trained models ready for deployment
- `experiments/`: Experimental model variations

## Note
Due to file size constraints, model files may be stored using Git LFS or external storage solutions. Please refer to the documentation for model download instructions.
